# ZSD Analytics
Deployed at http://zsdanalytics.com

A personal project I started earlier this year, ZSD Analytics is my way of learning front end and back end development through a web application. The web app is meant to make use of the exploration and analytics of MLB data that I did during the summer and fall of 2020. I started out with Flask, building a simple web application, then transitioned into learning JavaScript and React to build out the base functionality of the site. The next steps involved creating an API from the MLB data which is stored in a MySQL database. Once basic functionality was implemented the front end was styled using Bootstrap CSS.

#### Features planned to be added:
* Add filter for specific pitch types
* Player Overview support for batters - Completed
* Player Comparison
* Pitcher-Batter Matchups
* Postseason Statistics
* Support for Additional Seasons (Currently only 2019 Regular Season data is supported)

I plan to do plenty of code refactoring as I implement features, as much of the site is being developed alongside learning the languages and practices. I hope to deploy an initial version of the site soon.
